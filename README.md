# portfolio
This is a simple portfolio website I designed for fun. The goal of the project was to demonstrate the ability to utilize the GitHub Copilot extension within VSCode to create a simple website quickly and efficiently. By making use of powerful prompts, I created this website in a fraction of the time it would have taken me to code from scratch. I plan on creating a more complex portfolio website in the future to properly demonstrate my skillset.<br/>
